# arweave-fetch
Fetch content from Arweave on a webpage using JavaScript. 

# steps

1. put content on Arweave as a text file but only containing HTML.

2. fetch content by adding html page to the site host as index.html or whatever page you want.

# future

in the future, node.js may be used to fetch html from Arweave and render it as HTML served to page requester, so it is not visible to user that javascript is being used to retrieve content from Arweave, but rather that the page is being served natively from the site host. this may be a different project.
